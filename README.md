### Built with

### What I learned

It was my first time using a Figma file. The project was fairly small, but I could already see how useful it is and how much it could speed up my workflow.

### Continued development

I want to further refine my skills, as there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Once I become more comfortable, I’ll start incorporating more best practices into my code.
